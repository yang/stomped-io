Design Notes
============

Can start out with this simple linear lava, but consider adding something wave-y like this:

Dev Notes
=========

- May want to consider using simpler [AABB-only physics engine](https://gist.github.com/BonsaiDen/6144232).
- Bot names from https://www.findnicknames.com/cool-gamer-tags/

Multiplayer Engines
-------------------

- IGE: only supports interpolation; odd conventions
- Colyseus: focused on administrivia
- Timeline: simple micro library for interpolation
- Lance:
  - requires heavy framework buy-in, I foresee fighting against it
  - extrapolation is over *everything*, not selective player-affected things

Ultimately, just going with home-rolled (maybe with some assistance from
TImeline), but Lance seems like the most promising if things get hairy quickly.

Misc
----

- `moduleResolution: node` is from
  https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8189
